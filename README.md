# mediaplayer   

Project made as a workshop for Platzi's DOM Manipulation course.


## Project description

Create a video player that enables the user to play, pause, mute, interact with the timeline, etc.

## Personal goals in this project

1. There is a json folder, it contains the usernames, videos and comments description. My personal goal is to communicate with these jsons and add them to the project. Make them a little more interesting rather than a static webpage.
